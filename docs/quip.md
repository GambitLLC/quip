# What is Quip?

Quip or quip.gg is a competitive crypto gaming platform where players can deposit various cryptocurrencies and then wager said deposited crypto on a skill based game.  The players performance in the game will determine what their dividends from particiaption will be.  



>  Simply put, if you score or place higher in the game, your initial return on investment will be higher.



# How does Quip work?

Players first need to deposit crypto into their account before they are able to participate in any wager matches.  Once a player deposits some sort of cryptocurrency into their account (BTC, ETH, DOGE, etc) they will be credited quip coin, a centralized token that quip will faciliate the exchange of.  



>  Exchaning quip coin can be done at a rate of $1 USD to 1000 QUIP



Quip coin can then be used to wager on any of our competitive skill based games.



# Wagering

Each individual match on quip can be thought of as an escrow account.  While the match is ongoing the results are not known and the pool of money cannot be distributed.  Once the results of a match are final, the distribution of funds can be performed.  A typical distribution for games played on quip will be as follows:

1. House fee - 10% of pool
2. top 50% of participants - 90% of pool
3. bottom 50% of participants - 0% of pool



> The above distribution is an example, but represents the average case
